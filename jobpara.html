            <li>The planets do see employment in your future—just as soon as Mercury stops playing hide and seek with your career path!

            <li>I see a job on the horizon! Of course, it might just be a mirage. Better keep those resumes handy.


            <li> Good news! There’s a job waiting for you. Bad news? It’s still buffering. Try refreshing the universe?
            </li><br>


            <li> The planets say ‘yes’ to a job soon! Although they’re notoriously vague on the word soon.
