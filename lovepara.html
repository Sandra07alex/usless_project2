            <li>Marriage is on the horizon... just make sure to bring a telescope, because that horizon is way out there.

            <li>The planets suggest marriage could happen... in the same way Pluto suggests it's a planet. So, sorta but maybe not?


            <li>According to my calculations, your wedding date is right around the corner! Just... on the 13th month of the year.
