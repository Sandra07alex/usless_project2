            <li> Ah, the economy! The stars say it’s like a rollercoaster—hold on tight and maybe avoid looking down."

            <li>I checked the stars, and they say the economy is doing… well, something. They’re just not saying what that something is.

            <li>The economy? It’s in a phase. Kind of like Mercury in retrograde, but with everyone’s wallet involved.
            </li><br>


            <li>The planets suggest a stable economy… but they’re known to be wildly optimistic, so take that with a pinch of stardust.
