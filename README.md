A playful, online astrologist for the curious soul! Our project gives you a peek into "life spoilers" with a dash of humorâ€”think of it as your virtual fortune-teller with a twist. Get ready to see predictions you didn't even know you wanted!

## The Problem (that doesnâ€™t exist)
People everywhere are desperate to know the exact date they'll, well, not make it. And letâ€™s be real, life would be so much easier if we had personalized spoilers! From "When will I finally become a billionaire?" to "Will I ever win at karaoke?"â€”the thirst for outrageous life predictions is real... or is it?
